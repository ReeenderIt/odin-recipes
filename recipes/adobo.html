        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork belly, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 onion, peeled and sliced thinly</li>
            <li>1 head garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>1 cup vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine pork, onions, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a wide, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add meat mixture and cook, turning occasionally, until pork is lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add vinegar and allow to boil, uncovered and without stirring, for about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and water and stir to combine. Allow to a boil for another 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 40 to 50 minutes or until meat is fork-tender and sauce is reduced. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cook off the strong vinegar flavor by allowing it to boil uncovered and without stirring for a good few minutes before adding the soy sauce and water.</li>
            <li>If you want to season the dish with more salt than called for in the recipe, I suggest adding it during the last few minutes of cooking to correctly gauge taste. The flavor of the dish will concentrate as the sauce reduces.</li>
        </ul>
